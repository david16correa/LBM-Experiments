# Dragged particle

This is a experiment designed to test transfer of momentum between solids and the fluid. It essentially consists of a whirlpool-like flow (generated by the boundaries around the fluid), and a passive particle that's dragged around. Both linear and angular momentum are transferred to the particle, and both objects exchange momentum throughout (due to inertia).
