# Testing image particle

The idea is to understand the effect of a nearby wall on a rotating (but otherwise stationary) particle. To do this, two experiments will be carried out, one with the wall and one without it. Subtracting the resulting fluid velocity for both cases should result in the fluid velocity produced by an "image particle".
