# Couette to induce rotation

In this experiment two walls are placed on the top and the bottom. These are designed to move on opposing directions, driving the fluid and generating a Couette profile that goes from $-a$ to $a$. A spherical particle is placed in the middle, and is allowed to rotate. It is expected that the particle's angular momentum will reach a stable value, thus reaching stable equilibrium.
