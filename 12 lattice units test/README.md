# lattice units test

Throughout the development of LBMengine.jl, physical units have always been (mis)used. This should not be done due to stability issues that could (should) come up. It's long been in my to-do list to fix this, and the swimmer has given me so much trouble that I'm now running a (questionable) test with lattice units. This is the result.
